    "Type 1 diabetes is a disease which results from loss of the beta cells within the pancreas.  Such cells produce insulin, which controls the glucose level in your blood.  When glocuse is too high one feels sick, and verve damage is possible.  When glucose is too low I can go unconciouss, and there is a risk of falling into a coma."

    "Let $g(t)$ denote the blood glucose level at time $t$.  Assume insulin is administered at times $\\{ t_{i,k} \\}_{k=1}^{N_i}$ and food intake at times $\\{ t_{f,k} \\}_{k=1}^{N_f}$\n",

    "        + c_f \\left( \\sum_{t_{f,j} < t } \\int_{t_{f,j} }^t \\frac{\\tau}{\\lambda_f} e^{-\\tau / \\lambda_f } d\\tau \\right) + Noise.\n",

    "This might be a good model to try first.  One critique is that it allows for the implausible cases where $g(t) < 0$.\n",

    "### Model 3:\n",
    "To prohibit unusually high glucose readings we consider a function which diverges to infinity at $600$ mg/dL and diverges to negative infinity at zero.  For example, we could consider a rescaled and offset `arctanh` function.\n",
